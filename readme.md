### 2. Solids of revolution
Create a 3D solid of revolution out of a flat profile. Use the mouse to draw the profile and right-click to convert it into a 3D object. The object is moveable. Use N key to start a new project. Use P key to display one previous object stored in memory.

The outline is rotated and triangulation is performed between two consequent sets of rotated points. The matrix of 3D rotation is used.

### 1. Ping
Two-players 2D game. The gameflow allows multiple deaths before one player wins. The player is allowed to move in 2D within their part of game area. The ball collides with game area walls and the rackets. Additionally, when the ball is hit and pushed by the player it will follow the movement of the racket.

Use of PGraphics areas, sound effects, collisions detection (taking widths into consideration), keys and mouse position detection.

Partial use of OOP (Ball, Rackets) to facilitate spatial control of elements and collisions detection.
