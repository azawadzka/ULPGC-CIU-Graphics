### 1. Ping
Two-players 2D game. The gameflow allows multiple deaths before one player wins. The player is allowed to move in 2D within their part of game area. The ball collides with game area walls and the rackets. Additionally, when the ball is hit and pushed by the player it will follow the movement of the racket.

Use of PGraphics areas, sound effects, collisions detection (taking widths into consideration), keys and mouse position detection.

Partial use of OOP (Ball, Rackets) to facilitate spatial control of elements and collisions detection.
